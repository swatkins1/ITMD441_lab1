Technical Requirements
All Students:
• Use only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
• Use CSS for layout and styling (flexbox or grid encouraged).
• No element should appear with browser default styling — all text elements (headings,
paragraphs, links, lists) must be styled.
• Page should be mobile-friendly (readable on both desktop and mobile).
• Hosted publicly on GitHub Pages with the link submitted.
• Commit to GitHub early and often — multiple, meaningful commits are expected
throughout the development process, not just a single final commit.
